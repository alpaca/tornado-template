================

This repository is currently put on hold until we create an implementation of a single threaded concurrent celery worker that relies on non-blocking tasks via explicit yields. This can ideally be an addition to the https://github.com/mher/tornado-celery/ repository which currently provides a non-blocking producer (not non-blocking consumer).
